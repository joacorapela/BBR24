\subsection{Context}

Current animal experimentation in Neuroscience is mostly contrained to simple,
well controlled and short duration experiments. 
%
More sophyticated and long-duration experiments, where animals can move freely
in naturalistic environments, could reveal new aspects of behavior and brain
function.
%
At the Sainsbury Wellcome Centre (SWC) for Neural Circuits and Behavior and the
Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit (GCNU) we are developing hardware and
software infrastucture to perform long-duration and naturalistic foraging
experiments, as well as advanced machine learning methods to control and
extract insights from the data generated by these experiments.
%
Here we propose to create a resource to share openly our hardware and software
infrastructure to build long-duration experiments, and the machine learning
methods that we are buildingto process the data generated by these experiments.
This resource will also provide online support to people using the distributed
technlogy.

% hardware advances
%
% Goncalo please improve this paragraph
Recent hardware and software developments now enable advanced animal
experimentation.
% 
It is now possible to precisely monitor animal behavior with 2D and 3D video
cameras.
%
It is also now possible to record spikes of hundreads and thousands of neurons
simultaneously~\citep{neuropixels}.

% software advances Niko please help improve the following
Machine learning software now allows sophisticating processing of the output of
these cameras to, for example, track body parts of single~\citep{deeplabCut}
and multiple~\citep{sleap} animals, or infer animal behavioral
syllables~\citep{moseq}.
%
Real time and close loop complex animal experiments can now be easily developed
using open source software for visual reactive programming~\citep{bonsai}.

\subsection{The research the infrastructure, facility or resource will enable}

The hardware and software infrastructure we propose to distribute will enable
an unprecdented type of long-duration naturalistic experimentation, as well as
novel insights extracted from the application of new machine learning methods
to the data generated by these experiments.

\subsection{Aims and objectives}

% 1. share behavioral and electrophysiolical recordings from long-duration and naturalistic foraging experiments
% 2. share hardware and software specifications to build long-duration naturalistic experiments
% 3. share machine learning methods, and their implementations, for online and offline processing the data generated by these experiments
% 4. provide advise to people interested in use the distributed data, hardware, software and methods.
