\subsection{Context}

% add references
The use of large amounts of data in image and speech recognition and more
recently in large language models has generated breakthroughs in the
capabilities of machine learning models. Yet, most animal experiments in
Neuroscience still generate limited amounts of data, as animal behavior is
heavily constrained and the duration of experiments is short.
%
Long-duration experiments, where animals can move freely in naturalistic
environments, combined with advanced machine learning methods, could reveal new
aspects of behavior and brain function not evident in data generated in simpler
experiments.
%
At the Sainsbury Wellcome Centre (SWC) for Neural Circuits and Behavior and the
Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit (GCNU) we are developing hardware and
software infrastucture to perform long-duration and naturalistic foraging
experiments, as well as creating advanced machine learning methods to control
these experiments and extract insights from the generated data.
%
Here we propose to create a resource to share openly (1) behavioral and
electrophysiolocial recordings generated by our foraging experiments, (2)
hardware and software infrastructure to build long-duration and naturalistic
experiments, (3) machine learning methods to process the data generated by
these experiments, and (4) provide online support to people using the
distributed data, hardware, software and methods.

\subsection{The research the infrastructure, facility or resource will enable}

The hardware, software and user support we propose to distibute will allow
research groups around the world to develop their own long-duration and
naturalistic experiments, enabling a new type of animal experimentation.

These experiments are costly, since they require specialized arenas to house
freely behaving animals for extended periods of time, as well as hardware and
software to monitor their behavior, to perform neural recording and to store
large amounts of data. For researchers not able to develop their own
experiments, we will share openly behavioral and physiological recordings
from our mouse foraging experiments, enabling them to study long-duration mouse
foraing at the behavioral and physilogical levels.

The foraging experiments require behavioral and neural manipulations in real
time, for which online machine learning algorithms are needed. In addition, the
very large size of the datasets generated by these experiments demand novel
machine learning methods. Thus, these foraging experiments generate new demands
of machine learning algorithms that will be addressed with novel machine
learning methods developed by us and/or by machine learning scientists using
the openly shared foraging data.

\subsection{Aims and objectives}

The aims of the proposed resource are:

\begin{enumerate}

    \item share behavioral and electrophysiolical recordings from long-duration
        and naturalistic foraging experiments,

    \item share hardware and software specifications to build long-duration
        naturalistic experiments,

    \item share machine learning methods, and their implementations, for online
        and offline processing the data generated by these experiments,

    \item provide online advise to scientists interested in use the distributed
        data, hardware, software and methods.

\end{enumerate}
