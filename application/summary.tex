\subsection{Context}

% add references
The use of large amounts of data in image and speech recognition and more
recently in large language models has generated breakthroughs in the
capabilities of machine learning models. Yet, most animal experiments in
Neuroscience still generate limited amounts of data, as animal behaviour is
heavily constrained and the duration of experiments is short.
%
Long-duration experiments, where animals can move freely in naturalistic
environments, combined with advanced machine learning methods, could reveal new
aspects of behaviour and brain function not evident in data generated in
simpler experiments.
%
At the Sainsbury Wellcome Centre (SWC) for Neural Circuits and Behaviour we are
performing long-duration and naturalistic foraging experiments.
%
Here we propose to create a resource to share openly online and offline machine
learning methods to process behavioural and neural data generated by these
experiments. Every method shared in this resource will be demonstrated with
data from the SWC foraging experiments.

\subsection{The research the infrastructure, facility or resource will enable}

Advanced machine learning software is essential to extract insights from the
data generated by naturalistic and long-duration experiments. Thus, the software
disseminated by our resource will be essential to extract insights from these
experiments and could generate valuable findings.

In addition, the evaluation of different models on our foraging datasets should
help researchers analysing long-duration and naturalistic experiments choose the
best models for their needs, accelerating their research.

Our resource could also motivate research and development on novel machine
learning methods for controlling and characterising long-duration and
naturalistic experiments, as our foraging datasets could act as a testbed for
methods comparison, and machine learning scientists may want to develop methods
to excel in this comparison.

\subsection{Aims and objectives}

The first aim of the proposed resource is to enable a new type of
long-duration and naturalistic animal experimentation, by sharing well-tested
machine learning methods for online and offline processing of data generated by
these experiments.

A second aim is to build a resource that is a reference where the best machine
learning methods to control and characterise long-duration naturalistic
experiments can be compared against each other on state-of-the-art foraging
datasets.

\subsection{Potential user communities, applications and benefits}

The following user communities could benefit from the proposed resource:

\begin{description}

    \item[research groups investigating data from long-duration naturalistic
        experiments] could use the distributed machine learning software to analyse their
        data and generate scientific discoveries.

    \item[business entities] using long-duration and/or naturalistic
        experiments could benefit from our distributed software and improve
        their processes. For example, pharmaceutical businesses are starting to
        use whole animal screening to test for side effects on drugs. They
        could use our distributed software to improve animal behavioural and
        neural monitoring.

    \item[machine learning methods developers] could contribute their methods
        to the resource, so that they are evaluated on our foraging data, and
        become known to users of our repository.
