  abstract={An apparatus has been developed to study the phase-locked occipital
response at stimulus frequency evoked by modulated light. Intensity and phase
have been measured over a range of sinusoidal modulation frequencies for
steady-state stimuli. A transient and an average steady-state response have
been found and identified mainly with the central retinal region. The average
steady-state response is independent of $\alpha$ activity. The $\alpha$
frequency is independent of the stimulus. The steady-state response peaks, and
shows a rapid phase shift, in the neighbourhood of 10 c/sec. At higher stimulus
modulation frequencies the average phase lag of the phase-locked response is
proportional to stimulus frequency. An estimate is made of the transport time
of the synchronous component. High frequency attenuation is less than that for
subjective flicker as measured by De Lange. The nature of the phase-locked
response and theoretical models are discussed.}
